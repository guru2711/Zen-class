
	Scripting languages are programming languages that don't require an explicit compilation step.

For example, in the normal case, you have to compile a C program before you can run it. But in the normal case, you don't have to compile a JavaScript program before you run it. So JavaScript is sometimes called a "scripting" language.

	Some examples of "scripting" languages (e.g., languages that are traditionally used without an explicit compilation step):

Lua
JavaScript
VBScript and VBA
Perl
And a small smattering of ones traditionally used with an explicit compilation step:

C
C++
D
Java (but note that Java is compiled to bytecode, which is then interpreted and/or recompiled at runtime)
Pascal
